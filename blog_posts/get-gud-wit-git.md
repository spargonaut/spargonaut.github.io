Lets Get good with git!


Over the course of my career, I've used a variety of programming languages, IDEs and other
tools to write software.  

**One tool that has almost always been there, is Git.**

These are some of my favorite resources for learning, brushing up, or simply playing with
git.
  - [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
    - The tutorials are great, and they come with a CLI to practice your git commands
    - This site is probably my favorite in this list because it builds a
    diagram of your commit stack as you run the commands in the tutorials. 
    - It also comes with a sandbox in case you want to build a diagram of your commit
    stack without having to go through the tutorials
  - [How Git Works: The Comic by Julia Evans](https://store.wizardzines.com/products/how-git-works)
    - This is a great comic full of bite sized pieces of the inner workings of git
    - I learned a LOT, and I already know how to use git pretty well.
  - [The Git docs](https://git-scm.com/doc)
    - The official resource for all things git.
    - As far as developer docs go, these are pretty nice.
